Hadoop is a distributed data processing framework.
A cluster contains a master and multiple slave nodes.
HDFS stores data in large distributed blocks.
The namenode manages metadata and file structure.
The datanodes store actual data blocks across machines.
MapReduce divides tasks into map and reduce stages.
Each mapper processes a portion of the input dataset.
Reducers aggregate intermediate results from mappers.
Replication provides fault tolerance in Hadoop.
Big data systems require scalability and high availability.
Spark is a fast in memory data processing engine.
Yarn handles resource management for Hadoop jobs.
Machine learning algorithms need a large volume of data.
Cloud platforms allow elastic scaling of Hadoop clusters.
Real time data processing is used in financial applications.
Kafka streams continuous data from producers to consumers.
Python is widely used for data engineering and analytics.
SQL is useful for querying structured datasets.
Data pipelines automate extraction transformation and loading.
Automation improves efficiency in big data workflows.
